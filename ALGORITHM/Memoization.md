# Memoization

Memoization is a technique used in computing to speed up programs. This is done by caching the outputs of a function for future use (=memorizing the calculation results of function calls)

> What is Caching?
>
> In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.

If the same input of a function call with the same parameters is used, the previously stroed results can be used again an unnecssary calculations are avoided.

## Example (factorial)

```python
factorial_memo = {}

def factorial(n):
    if n<2:
        return 1
    if n not in factorial_memo:
        factorial_memo[n] = n * factorial(n-1)
    return factorial_memo[n]

n = 5
print(factorial(n))
```
