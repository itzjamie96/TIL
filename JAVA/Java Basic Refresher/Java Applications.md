# Java Applications



### Popular Java Applications

Java applications typically are written in three forms

- console applications
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- web and mobile applications



## Java Console Applications

- run from the command prompt
- the user interacts with the application by reading data output on the command line
- the user interacts by entering data into the command line
- considered relatively low in user experience
- mostly for experts only, and usually for a very specific purpose



## Java GUI Applications

- operate the exact same as all GUI applications
- users interact using a visual environment that is highly user friendly
- support mouse and other pointing devices => based on events (like user clicks)
- from user perspective, there are no differences between GUI applications built with different languages
- developer should instantiate the GUI classes to run the application



## Web and Mobile Applications

- work on a multi-tiered architecture

- the developer only has general knowledge of the user environment, which is mostly a variation of a web browser

- the browser is the top layer of the architecture

- run on a special software called **Web Application Server**

- the WAS instantiates the Java classes and runs the Java code to build pages of the application

- WAS is runtime only

- no data is stored on the app server => all data is stored in the database
